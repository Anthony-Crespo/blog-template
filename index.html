            printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type
            specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also
            the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially

            Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more
            recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker
